# Aether Framework Roadmap

## Alpha (v0.1.0)
**Focus:** HTTP/1.1 compliance, routing, and middleware.

### Core Features
- [x] **HTTP/1.1 Compliance**
  - [x] Full support for HTTP/1.1 protocol.
  - [x] Proper handling of `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.
  - [ ] Support for `Expect: 100-continue`. `// add in the future`
  - [x] Graceful handling of malformed requests.
  - [ ] Connection keep-alive and timeouts. `// add in the future`

- [x] **Routing**
  - [x] Basic route handling (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
  - [x] Dynamic route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`).
  - [x] Regex-based route patterns (e.g., `/users/:id(\d+)`).
  - [x] Wildcard routes (e.g., `/files/*`).
  - [x] Route grouping and prefixing (e.g., `/api/v1/*`).

- [x] **Middleware**
  - [x] Basic middleware chaining (`app.use()`).
  - [x] Support for async middleware.
  - [x] Error-handling middleware.
  - [x] Middleware-specific context (e.g., passing data between middleware).

## Beta (v0.5.0)
**Focus:** Static file serving, error handling, and security features.

### Core Features
- [ ] **Static File Serving**
  - [ ] Serve static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS).
  - [ ] MIME-type detection based on file extensions.
  - [ ] Range requests for large files (e.g., video streaming).
  - [ ] Caching headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `ETag`).
  - [ ] Directory listing (optional, configurable).

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Centralized error handling (e.g., global error handler).
  - [ ] Structured logging (e.g., JSON logs with timestamps, request IDs).
  - [ ] Detailed error responses (e.g., JSON error messages for API endpoints).
  - [ ] Custom error pages (e.g., 404, 500).

- [ ] **Security Features**
  - [ ] HTTPS support (TLS/SSL).
  - [ ] Basic security middleware (e.g., `helmet`-like headers).
  - [ ] Rate limiting to prevent abuse.
  - [ ] Request validation and sanitization (e.g., prevent SQL injection, XSS).
  - [ ] CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support.

  - [ ] Unit tests for core components (e.g., `HttpParser`, `MiddlewareStack`).
  - [ ] Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios.
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks (e.g., compare with Node.js, Flask, etc.).
  - [ ] High-load testing (e.g., 10k+ concurrent connections).
  - [ ] CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Comprehensive API documentation (e.g., Doxygen or Markdown).
  - [ ] "Getting Started" guide with step-by-step instructions.
  - [ ] Example projects (e.g., REST API, static file server).
  - [ ] FAQ section for common issues and troubleshooting.
  - [ ] Inline code comments for key components.

- [ ] **Platform Support**
  - [ ] Test and support Linux, Windows, and macOS.
  - [ ] Add CMake or Bazel build scripts for easy compilation.
  - [ ] Provide precompiled binaries for common platforms.
